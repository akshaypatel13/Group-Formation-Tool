The project repository was managed on GitLab and the CI/CD pipeline was setup to automate the software delivery process. The development was deployed on two Environments - Test and Production based on the branching in the repository. The CI/CD pipeline directly deploys the web application on Heroku Hosting Platform that fulfills the gap between development and deployment with the help of building, testing and deployment of application.
